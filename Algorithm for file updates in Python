#step 1: Assign `import_file` to the name of the file 
import_file = "allow_list.txt"

#step 2: Assign `remove_list` to a list of IP addresses that are no longer allowed to access restricted information. 

remove_list = ["192.168.97.225", "192.168.158.170", "192.168.201.40", "192.168.58.57"]

#step 3: Read the file contents
with open(import_file, "r") as file:
    ip_addresses = file.read()

#step 4: Use `.split()` to convert `ip_addresses` from a string to a list
ip_addresses = ip_addresses.split()

#step 5: Build iterative statement
#step 6 then current element should be removed from `ip_addresses`

for element in ip_addresses:
    if ip_addresses in remove_list:
        ip_addresses.remove(element)

# Step 7: Convert back to string
ip_addresses = " ".join(ip_addresses)

# Step 8: Write updated content back to file
with open(import_file, "w") as file:
    file.write(ip_addresses)

# step 9:  Print to verify
with open(import_file, "r") as file:
